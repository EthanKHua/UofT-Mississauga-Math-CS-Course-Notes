\section{Week 3 Homework}
    \exercise Let $S\subseteq C[0,1]$. Consider the following two statements:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item $S$ is an open subset of $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_1)$.
        \item $S$ is an open subset of $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_\infty)$.
    \end{itemize}
    Determine if the first statement implies the second, and vice-versa. Supply proof or counterexample as appropriate.

    \begin{proof}
        We claim that the first statement implies the second, but not the converse.

        Suppose that \(S\) is an open subset of \((C[0,1], \|\cdot\|_1)\). For any \(g \in S\), there is an open ball with respect to the 1-norm centered around \(g\) with radius \(\varepsilon\) such that \(B_1 (g, \varepsilon)\subseteq S\). We proceed to show that \(B_\infty (g, \varepsilon) \subseteq B_1 (g, \varepsilon)\). Let \(f \in B_\infty (g, \varepsilon)\). Then \(\|f-g\| _\infty < \varepsilon\). Thus we have
        \[
            \|f-g\| _1 = \int _0^1 \left\vert f-g \right\vert \leq \int _0^1 \sup \{ \left\vert f-g \right\vert \} = \|f-g\| _\infty < \varepsilon 
        \]
        Thus \(B_\infty (g, \varepsilon) \subseteq B_1 (g, \varepsilon) \subseteq S\). Thus \(S\) is an open subset of \((C[0,1], \|\cdot \| _1)\).

        Now we show that the converse is not necessarily true. Let \(S = B_\infty (0, 1)\). This is an open subset of \((C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_\infty)\). Consider \(f(x) = 0 \in B_\infty (0, 1)\). For every \(\varepsilon > 0\), we can always find \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(n > \frac{1}{\varepsilon}\). Let \(g(x) = x^{n-1}\). Since \(\int _0^1 g(x)dx = \frac{1}{n} < \varepsilon\), \(g(x) \in B_1(0, \varepsilon)\). But \(g(1) = 1\), which means that \(g(x) \notin B_\infty (0, 1)\). Thus \(f\) is not an interior point of \(B_\infty (0, 1)\) with respect to the 1-norm, which means that \(B_\infty (0, 1)\) is not an open subset of \((C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_1)\).
        
    \end{proof}

    \exercise Let $X$ be any set. The \textbf{diagonal} of $X\times X$ is the following set:
    \[ \Delta = \{(x,x) : x \in X\}. \]
    Prove that if $(X,d)$ is a metric space, then $\Delta$ is a closed subset of $X\times X$ (with respect to the product metric).

    \begin{proof}
        We define \(d\) as the metric in \(X\) and \(d_X\) to be the product metric of \(X \times X\). Suppose that \((X,d)\) is a metric space. We want to show that every limit point of \(\Delta\) is a member of \(\Delta\).

        Let \((a,b) \in X\times X\) be a limit point of \(\Delta\) and suppose for contradiction that \((a,b)\) is not an element of \(X\). This implies that \(d(a,b) > 0\). Consider the open ball \(B((a,b), d(a,b))\). For all \((x,x) \in X\), by the triangle inequality,
        \[
            d_X((a,b), (x,x)) = d(a,x) + d(b,x) \geq d(a,b)
        \]
        This means that no element lies within this open ball centered around \((a,b)\), contradicting the fact that \((a,b)\) is a limit point of \(X\). Thus \((a,b) \in X\).

    \end{proof}

    \exercise\textit{Can linear subspaces be open and/or closed?}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Let $C^\infty[0,1]$ denote the set of infinitely differentiably functions $f:[0,1]\rightarrow \R$. Prove that $C^\infty[0,1]$ is \textit{not} a closed subset of $(C[0,1],\|\cdot\|_\infty)$.

        \begin{proof}
            To show that this set is not closed, we just need to find a limit point that is not an element of the set. Let \(f(x) = |x-\frac{1}{2}|\). Clearly \(f \notin C^{\infty} [0,1]\). To prove \(f\) is a limit point of \(C^{\infty} [0,1]\), first let \(\varepsilon > 0\) and consider the open ball \(B(f, \varepsilon)\). There exists an \(n \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(n > \frac{1}{\varepsilon^2} \implies \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} < \varepsilon\).

            Let \(g_n(x) = \sqrt{(x-\frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{1}{n}}\). Since \(x^2 + \frac{1}{n}\) is always positive and the squareroot function is infinitely differentiable for all positive real numbers, \(g_n\) is infinitely differentiable for all \(x \in [0,1]\). Our goal is to find an upper bound for \(|f - g_n|\). For convenience, we perform the change of variables \(t = x - \frac{1}{2}\). Define a new function in \(C[-\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]\) as \(h(t) = f(t) - g_n(t)\). We find the global maximum and minimum of \(h\). Taking the derivative with respect to \(t\), we obtain
            \[
                h^\prime (t) = \frac{|t|}{t} - \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}}}
            \]
            We see that \(h\) has a critical point at \(t = 0\) since \(h^\prime(0)\) is undefined.
            Note that \(\pm t \leq  |t| \leq \sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}} \implies \sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}} \pm t > 0\). If \(t > 0\),
            \[
                h^\prime (t) = 1 - \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}}} = \frac{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}} - t}{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}}} > 0
            \]
            If \(t < 0\),
            \[
                h^\prime (t) = -1 - \frac{t}{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}}} = \frac{-\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}} - t}{\sqrt{t^2 + \frac{1}{n}}} < 0
            \]
            Therefore \(h\) acheives a local minimum at \(t = 0\).
            We evaluate \(h\) at its critical points and endpoints:
            \[
                h\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{n}}
            \]
            \[
                h(0) = -\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
            \]
            \[
                h\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) = \frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{n}}
            \]
            By the monotonicity of the squareroot, \(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} < \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{n}} < \frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{n}} < 0\). Thus \(-\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\) is the global minimum of \(h\) and \(\frac{1}{2} - \sqrt{\frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{n}}\) is the global maximum of \(h\). Note that \(|h(0)| > |h(\frac{1}{2})|\). Thus
            \[
                \|f-g_n\| _\infty = \sup_{0\leq x\leq 1}\{|f(x)-g_n(x)|\} = \sup_{-\frac{1}{2} \leq t \leq \frac{1}{2}} \{|h(t)\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}} < \varepsilon
            \]
            Thus \(f\) is a limit point of \(C^{\infty}\), but is not a member of the set. Thus \(C^{\infty}\) is not closed.

        \end{proof}

        \item Let $C$ be the set of \textbf{convergent} sequences of real numbers. Prove that $C$ is a closed subset of $(\ell^\infty,\|\cdot\|_\infty)$.

        \begin{proof}
            Let \((a_n)_{n\geq1}\) be a limit point of \(C\). We want to show to \((a_n)\) is convergent. We will do this by showing that \((a_n)\) is a Cauchy sequence.

            Let \(\varepsilon > 0\). Using the fact that \((a_n)\) is a limit point of \(C\), there exists a convergent sequence \(b_n \in B((a_n), \frac{\varepsilon}{3}) \implies \forall k \in \mathbb{N}, |a_k - b_k| < \|(b_n) - (a_n)\| _\infty < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}\). Since \((b_n)\) converges, there is a \(N^\prime \in \mathbb{N}\) such that \(m,n \geq N \implies |b_m - b_n| < \frac{\varepsilon}{3}\).
            
            Let \(N = N^\prime\). Then for all \(m,n \geq N\), we have
            \[
                |a_m - a_n| = |(a_m - b_m) + (b_m - b_n) + (b_n - a_n)| \leq |(a_m - b_m)| + |b_m - b_n| + |b_n - a_n| < \frac{\varepsilon}{3} + \frac{\varepsilon}{3} + \frac{\varepsilon}{3} = \varepsilon
            \]
            Thus \((a_n)\) is a Cauchy sequence, and therefore converges, which means that \((a_n) \in C\). Thus \(C\) is closed.

        \end{proof}
        \item Let $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ be a normed vector space, and let $M$ be a \textcolor{red}{linear subspace} of $X$. Prove that $M$ is an open set if and only if $M=X$.
        
        \begin{proof}
            First, suppose that \(M=X\). Then for every \(x \in X\), any open ball centered around \(x\) is obviously a subset of \(X\). Thus \(M\) is open.

            Next, suppose that \(M\) is an open. To show that \(X=M\), it suffices to show that \(X \subseteq M\), since we already have \(M \subseteq X\) from \(M\) being a subspace of \(X\).

            Since \(M\) is a subspace, we know that \(0 \in M\). Thus there exists \(\varepsilon > 0\) such that \(B(0, \varepsilon) \subseteq M\).
            
            Let \(\beta\) be the basis for \(X\). For every \(\vec{x} \in \beta\), \(\left\lVert \frac{\varepsilon \vec{x}}{2\|\vec{x}\|} \right\rVert = \frac{\varepsilon\|\vec{x}\|}{2\|\vec{x}\|} = \frac{\varepsilon}{2} < \varepsilon\), which means that \(\frac{\varepsilon \vec{x}}{2\|\vec{x}\|} \in M\). Since \(M\) is a subspace, it follows that \(\beta \subseteq M \implies X = \operatorname{span} \beta \subseteq M\). Thus \(M=X\) and we are done.

        \end{proof}

    \exercise \textit{The Bolzano--Weierstrass Theorem.}

    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item Prove that every bounded sequence in $(\R^d,\|\cdot\|_2)$ has a convergent subsequence.
        
        \begin{proof}
            We take the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem in \(\mathbb{R}\) for granted and use this to prove it for \(\mathbb{R}^d\). We will do this using induction on \(d\). When \(d=1\), it follows trivially from the theorem in \(\mathbb{R}\).

            Now suppose that the claim is true for some \(d = k-1\), for some \(k \in \mathbb{N}\). Let \((a_n)_{n\geq1} \) be a bounded sequence in \((\R^k,\|\cdot\|_2)\). Define another sequence \((b_n)_{n\geq 1}\) in \(\mathbb{R}^{k-1}\) such that \(b_i\) is the first \(k-1\) components of \(a_i\). From our assumption, \(b_i\) has a convergent subsequence \((b_{n_i})_{i\geq1}\). Consider another sequence \((c_{n_i})_{i\geq0}\) in \(\mathbb{R}\) , where \(c_{n_i}\) is equal to the last component of \(a_{n_i}\). By the Theorem in \(\mathbb{R}\), \((c_{n_i})_{i\geq1}\) has a convergent subsequence \((c_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\). Since \((b_{n_i})_{i\geq1}\) converges, we know that \((b_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) converges to the same value as well. Suppose that \((b_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) converges to \(B = (B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{k-1})\) and \((c_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) converges to \(C\). We claim that \((a_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) is our desired subsequence, which converges to \((B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{k-1}, C)\).

            Let \(\varepsilon > 0\). Since \((B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{k-1})\) and \((c_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) converge,
            \[
                \exists N_b , N_c > 0 \text{ such that } n_b > N_b \implies \| b_{n_b} - B \| _2 < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}\text{ and } n_c > N_c \implies | c_{n_c} - C | < \frac{\varepsilon}{2}
            \]
            Let \(N = \max \{N_b, N_c\}\). Let \(n \in \mathbb{N}\), \(n > N\). Then
            \[
                \|a_n - (B_1, B_2, \dots, B_{k-1}, C) \| _2 = \sqrt{(a_1 - B_1)^2 + (a_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (a_{k-1} - B_{k-1})^2 + (a_k - C)^2} 
            \]
            Using an inequality that I don't know the name of, we have
            \[
                \sqrt{(a_1 - B_1)^2 + (a_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (a_{k-1} - B_{k-1})^2 + (a_k - C)^2}
            \]
            \[
                \leq \sqrt{(a_1 - B_1)^2 + (a_2 - B_2)^2 + \dots + (a_{k-1} - B_{k-1})^2} + \sqrt{(a_k - C)^2} = \| b_n - B \| _2 + | c_n - C | _2
            \]
            \[
                < \frac{\varepsilon}{2} + \frac{\varepsilon}{2} = \varepsilon
            \]
            Thus \((a_{n_{m_i}})_{i\geq1}\) converges, which means that \((a_n)_{n\geq1}\) does indeed have a convergent subsequence. By the principle of induction, the Bolzano-Weierstrass Theorem holds in \((\mathbb{R}^d, \|\cdot\|_2)\) and we are done.

        \end{proof}
        \item Give an example of a normed vector space $(X,\|\cdot\|)$ containing a \textcolor{red}{(bounded?)} sequence $(x_n)$ which has no convergent subsequences.
        
        \begin{proof}
            Consider the normed vector space \((\ell^{\infty}, \| \cdot \| _\infty)\). Let \((\vec{x_n})_{n\geq1}\) be a sequence in \((\ell^{\infty}, \| \cdot \| _\infty)\) defined by \(\vec{x_i}_k = \begin{dcases}
                1, &\text{ if } k=i ;\\
                0, &\text{ otherwise} .
            \end{dcases}\)

            Clearly \((\vec{x_n})_{n\geq1}\) is bounded. Let \((\vec{x_{n_i}})_{i\geq1}\) be a subsequence of \((\vec{x_n})_{n\geq1}\). We will show that \((\vec{x_{n_i}})_{i\geq1}\) diverges.

            For any \((L_k)_{k\geq1} \in \ell^{\infty}\) Let \(\varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}\). Let \(N \in \mathbb{N}\). If there are no values of \(p \geq N\) so that \(\|(\vec{x_p})_k - L_{k}\| _\infty < \varepsilon\), we are done. Now suppose the opposite, that there is a \(p \geq N\) such that \(\|(\vec{x_{p}})_k - L_{k}\|_\infty < \varepsilon\). Let \(n = p + 1\). By the reverse triangle inequality,
            \[
                \| (\vec{x_n})_k - L_k \|_\infty = \|(\vec{x_n})_k - (\vec{x_{p}})_k + (\vec{x_{p}})_k - L_k \| _\infty \geq \left|\|(\vec{x_n})_k - (\vec{x_{p}})_k \| _\infty - \|(\vec{x_{p}})_k - L_k \| _\infty \right| 
            \]
            \[
                = \left| 1 - \|(\vec{x_{p}})_k - L_k \| _\infty \right| \geq  1 - \varepsilon = \frac{1}{2}
            \]
            Thus \((\vec{x_{n_i}})_{i\geq1}\) diverges.

        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}
