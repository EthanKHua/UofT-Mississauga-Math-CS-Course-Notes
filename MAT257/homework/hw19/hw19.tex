        \textbf{Transverse intersction.} Let $M,N$ be two smooth surfaces in $\R^3$. We say that $M$ and $N$ \textbf{intersect transversally} if $T_pM\neq T_pN$ for all $p\in M\cap N$.
    
        \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
            \item Prove that if $M,N$ intersect transversally, then $M\cap N$ is a smooth curve in $\R^3$.
            \item Show by example that the conclusion of (a) fails without the assumption of transverse intersection.
        \end{enumerate}

        (a):

        Suppose that \(M\) and \(N\) intersect transversally. We will show that \(M \cap N\) is a smooth \(1\)-manifold in \(\mathbb{R}^3\). Let \(p \in M \cap N\).

        \medskip

        (b):

        Let \(M\) be the \(xy\)-plane, and let \(N\) be the graph of \(f(x,y) = x^2 + y^2\). Then \(M \cap N\) is simply the origin, which is not a smooth curve.
