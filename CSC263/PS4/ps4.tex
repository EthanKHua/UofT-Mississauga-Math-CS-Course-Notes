\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{[12 points]}
	You are given a weighted, connected, undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ and
    one of its minimum spanning trees $T\subseteq E$. Furthermore, you are guaranteed that the edge weights are all distinct.

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item \textbf{[6 points]}
        A new edge $(u, v)$ with weight $w_{u, v}\;(u, v\in V)$ is
        added to $G$, resulting in a new graph $G'=(V, E\cup \{(u,
        v)\})$. How do you efficiently find a minimum spanning tree
        $T'$ of $G'$? Describe and justify your algorithm in concise
        and precise English, and analyse its runtime. To get full
        marks, your algorithm's worst-case runtime must be in
        $\mathcal{O}(|V|)$.

      \item \textbf{[4 points]} Prove that the second lightest edge in the graph should belong to every minimum spanning tree.
      
      \item \textbf{[2 points]} Prove that the third lightest edge in the graph may not be in a minimum spanning tree.
        
    \end{enumerate}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item[2.] \textbf{[6 points]}
    You are given a $k \times k$ grid of squares (think of a chess board). Each square is identified by $(i,j) \in [k] \times [k]$ where $[k] = \{1,2,...,k\}$, $i$ is the row number, and $j$ is the column number. From any square you are allowed to make one of the following moves: (i) $m$ steps in the vertical direction and $n$ steps in the horizontal direction, or (ii) $n$ steps in the vertical direction and $m$ steps in the horizontal direction. If you encounter the edge of the board (either a vertical edge or a horizontal edge) while making the move, then the move is invalid. For example, if $m = 1$ and $n = 2$, then this corresponds to the moves made by the knight on a chess board. You play this game with your friend. Your friend first chooses a square $(i,j) \in [k]\times [k]$. Your task is to find another square $(i',j') \in [k] \times [k]$ such that there is no valid sequence of moves from $(i,j)$ to $(i',j')$, or declare that no such $(i',j')$ exists. Devise an $O(k^2)$ algorithm to solve this task.

\begin{enumerate}
\item[3.] \textbf{(12 points)}
  You are planning an around-the-world trip with your two best friends for the summer. 
There is a total of $n$ cities that the three of you want to visit.
As you are traveling around the world, you are worried about time zones and airport access. Therefore, some cities can only be visited after visiting another city first, which is in a nearby timezone or has an airport, which are expressed as a list of pairs (cityX,cityY) (cityX can only be visited after visiting cityY).

Given the total number of cities and a list of dependency pairs, is it possible for you all to visit all cities?

Your task is to write the function \verb|can_visit_all_cities|, which determines whether visiting the $n$ cities is possible or not given the dependencies. \textbf{(8 points)}

\textbf{Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Your code must be written in Python 3, and the filename must be \verb|ps4.py|.
\item We will grade only the \verb|can_visit_all_cities| function; please do not change its signature in the starter code. include as many helper functions as you wish.
\item You are {\bf not} allowed to use the built-in Python dictionary or set.
\item To get full marks, your algorithm must have average-case runtime
  ${O}(m + n),$ where $m$ is the number of dependencies given.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Input/Output Specification}
Please see the python starter code for input / output
specifications. 

\textbf{Write-up (4 points)}: in your \verb|ps4.pdf/ps4.tex| files,
include the following: an explanation of how your code works,
justification of correctness, and justification of desired
${O}(m + n)$ average-case runtime.
