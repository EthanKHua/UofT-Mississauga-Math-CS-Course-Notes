    \begin{question}{1}
        Use the general Principle of Inclusion-Exclusion to obtain a formula involving a summation for the number of ways to place $n$ identical balls into $k$ labeled bins so that no bin is left empty, where $n$ and $k$ are positive integers. Note that you may need to consider different possible cases for $n, k$ as necessary; make sure you show all your steps.

        Label the bins from \(1\) to \(k\). Let \(A_i\) be the ways to place the \(n\) balls into the \(k\) bins such that bin \(i\) has no balls. We want to count
        \[
            \left|A_1^C \cap \cdots \cap A_n^C\right|
        \]
